# Dublin-Bikes
** Version 1.0.0 **

A sample website to practice HTML5, CSS and Javascript.
I wanted to create a single page website for a ficticous shop "Dublin Bikes"

## Design 

I wanted a landing page with a full screen image and a bright colour palette. 

## Features

I made text animation and a slide in nav-bar for small screens using only vanilla JavaScript.
